        "Edward Hopper said that Nighthawks was inspired by “a restaurant on New York’s Greenwich 
        Avenue where two streets meet,” but the image—with its carefully constructed composition and lack of 
        narrative—has a timeless, universal quality that transcends its particular locale. One of the best-known 
        images of twentieth-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost 
        in their own thoughts, have congregated. Hopper’s understanding of the expressive possibilities of light 
        playing on simplified shapes gives the painting its beauty. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in
        the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. 
        Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the
        scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate 
        and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. (The red-haired woman was actually modeled by 
        the artist’s wife, Jo.) Hopper denied that he purposefully infused this or any other of his paintings 
        with symbols of human isolation and urban emptiness, but he acknowledged that in Nighthawks “unconsciously, 
        probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.” (Art Institute Chicago)</p> </span>
